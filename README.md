# Blogging Platform

This project comprises several HTML files for a blogging platform. Below is an overview of each file and its purpose.

### 1. **blog.html**
This file contains a form for creating blog posts. The form includes fields for the title, date, and text of the post. Styling is done using CSS, and there is a script at the end using jQuery to handle form submission (currently it's only capturing the input values).

### 2. **contacts.html**
This file presents information about the author, Alexandra Light. It includes details about her background, skills, and contributions as a professional writer. The styling is done using CSS, and the page is responsive to different screen sizes.

### 3. **index.html**
This file serves as the main page of the blogging platform. It includes a navigation bar with links to different sections: "Add post," "Blog," and "About author." The navigation items are animated, and the content is loaded dynamically in an iframe. Styling is done using CSS, and jQuery is used for navigation animations.

### 4. **post.html**
This file displays a list of blog posts. Each blog post includes a title, date, word count, read time, and a snippet of the post's content. The posts are currently static and can be extended to fetch data dynamically. Styling is done using CSS, and schema.org markup is used for better SEO.

## Instructions

1. To view the blogging platform, open `index.html` in a web browser.
2. Navigate through the different sections using the links in the navigation bar.
3. Check the blog section (`post.html`) to see static blog post examples.
4. Feel free to modify and extend the content, styling, or functionality based on your requirements.

**Note:** This is a basic structure, and additional features such as backend integration, dynamic content loading, and user authentication can be implemented for a more robust blogging platform.
